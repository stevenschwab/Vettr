Vettr is the ultimate tool for public relations and communications professionals. Browse our library of speaking, awards, content, and press opportunities to gain valuable insights curated by and for decision makers. Understand which opportunities are worth pursuing without devoting hours to research. Vettr offers three ways to use:

Vetting (Search): Look up the value of a specific opportunity.
Reviewing (Star Ratings / Open Ended): Input information about an opportunity
Inspiration (Browse/Sort): Find the best opportunities to pursue.

Our overall goal is to minimize the time spent doing research on opportunities across hard-to-find criteria and to find data to support recommendations.
Vettr offers a similar experience to vetting a software vendor on G2. It allows you to search for a specific opportunity, such as the Shoptalk conference, and land on a page that has ratings based on input from other users, much like leaving a Yelp review. You can rate a specific experience across various criteria and leave text-based reviews in an open-ended response field.

For example, you may want to pursue a speaking opportunity at a conference that will drive high awareness. You can sort the Speaking page by overall rating or a certain criteria such as Press Coverage (out of 5 stars), Sales Value (out of 5 stars), Time Commitment (out of 5 stars), Overall ROI (out of 5 stars), Attendee Presence (out of 5 stars), Sponsorship/Fee Required (Yes/No), Media Attendance (Yes/No), Submission Deadline (Date).

Vettr aims to reduce the typical vetting headaches such as researching audience, reach, and professional quality of a podcast or conference, allowing you to make an informed decision on which opportunities to pursue and which to pass on.

With Vettr, you can save time, find new opportunities and make better decisions. Download Vettr today and elevate your public relations and communications strategy.
